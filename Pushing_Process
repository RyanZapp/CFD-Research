In order to make a new matlab file and get it to the github, we need a few things:

1 - open the Github Desktop app

2 - open matlab in the location of the cloned repository

3 - create a new script

4 - write script

5 - save script in cloned repository

6 - highlight script name, right click, go to source control, and click "add to git"

7 - Once again, highlight script name, right click, go to source control, and click "view and commit"
  You will be prompted to enter a message...this message should briefly describe the changes made.

8 - Once again, highlight script name, right click, go to source control, and click "push" , then enter your Github username and password

9 - the action above will push the changes to the local repository on your Github Desktop app

10 - from the Github desktop app, allow that local changes to be made on the remote repository that exists on Github.com

11 - If you are simply editing files rather than creating new ones, you do not need to do steps 3 through 6.
