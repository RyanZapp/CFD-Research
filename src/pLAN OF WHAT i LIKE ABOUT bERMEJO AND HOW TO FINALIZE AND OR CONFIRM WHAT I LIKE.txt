The work he did with hoy was really interesting because it allows me to touch finite element and finite volume methods, as well as turbulence closure models
(AKA LES), plus, it was applied to solve a problem that has direct engineering applications (hypersonic vehicles). Also, it has underlying physics that
you need to understand. Basically, it allows me to put my fingers in all of the pies, which I love



I think I should read his other article about the passive mixing, and see if I like it. If not, I should just dive deeper into the articles he wrote with J Hoy
